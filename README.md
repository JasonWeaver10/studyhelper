# README

StudyHelper is a quiz / study app originally designed to help new developers learn different languages. The app will have different quizzes for different languages, and each page will have a series of random questions that users can answer. The app will save the high score and show them the answers to questions they missed. The app will allow users to upload their own questions and language preferences. I changed the app to allow topics and questions about anything, so it is no longer only useful to developers. 

This app was created using a Ruby on Rails back end, and a React front end. 

User Feedback:

Feedback strongly suggested not making the app Language Specific
  * Changed Language to Topic
  * Users can now add any type of questions on any topic that they need to study
Feedback wanted the ability to edit and delete questions and answers
  * Added edit / delete page, and an edit page so they are fully editable
